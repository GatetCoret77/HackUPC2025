To implement the ChatBot used in this Project we used a versi√≥n of Ollama called gemma3:4b-it-qat.
The local server to access this AI is stored in cat-helper-backend and due to its size and not being able to use it anyways because you need to download Ollama we've omitted some parts of it in our repository.
All the other functionalities are still working unless the chatbot, that should give fetch error.
However, during the demo we'll show our program working as expected with the AI installed in our computer.
